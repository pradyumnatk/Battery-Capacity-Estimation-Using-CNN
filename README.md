# Battery-Capacity-Estimation-Using-CNN
Contains models developed for capacity estimation of batteries using EIS Impedance Curves and CC-CV Charging curves


1. SoH Impedance - This file contains code based on the following paper

SOH Estimation of the Battery using CNN and Impedance Spectrum
https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/SOH-Estimation-of-the-Battery-using-CNN-and-Pradyumna-Khan/ff17f122463dfd0bd0cc7a8a04b03788ee9566fb

The model and results mentioned in the paper may not match with the results in the file due to some changes made for testing different things

2. SoH CCCV - This file contains code based on the following paper

A deep learning method for online capacity estimation of lithium-ion batteries
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352152X19302233

The model developed is only to check the implementation of the idea presented in the paper.

More accurate predictions may be possible with parameter tuning of the model.
